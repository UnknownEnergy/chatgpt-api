**Web app**: https://chatworm.com/  
**Android app**: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chatworm.twa  
**Windows app**: https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/chatworm/9N1RF0VWV3SN  
  
Works also with the newest **GTP-4** Version if you got access from OpenAI to the new GTP4 model via API.  
Otherwise you have to wait and can use the older models instead.  
  
This is a single page application there is no server between your browser and Open AI. The app is just downloaded and cached by your browser and you communicate directly with the API.
